# Face Object Detection STM32N6 Model Deployment

This tutorial demonstrates how to deploy a pre-trained face object detection model built with quantized tflite or ONNX QDQ on an STM32N6 board using STEdgeAI.

This demo provides a simple method for deploying a Face Object Detection model based on the YOLOv8n model to the STM32N6. Improving the model's accuracy or preparing additional datasets is up to the user.

</BR>For more details and information about the STM32N6, visit the official ST website.
